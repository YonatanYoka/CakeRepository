# CakeRepository
Cake store! the idea was to create a closed system for the cake store manager to receive / add / track and modify orders he recevies for hes store.

the program is rellaying on EF Core using the Model First approach. the usage and implementation of tasks seem'd to me like a good option even though the scale of the project is relativly small.

the usage of CMD over Winform and WPN seemd to me more basic and simple in comparison to the others. the system is built in a way which can be implamented easlly on any other ui layout.

thank you for your time Yehonatan Yeheskely
